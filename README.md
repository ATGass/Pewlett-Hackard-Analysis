# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The main idea behind this analysis was to assess how many people are of retirement age. By identifying those employees we can ask them to be apart of a mentorship program and best prepare for the day they retire. 

## Results
### Retiring Employees
Currently there are 240,124 employees at Pewlett-Hackard. You can see the breakdown of all employees by department from the image below:

### Mentors
There are 1,549 employees that fit into the mentor category. This is only 4.7% of all retiring employees. 

### Overall
* 13.7% of all employees will retire soon.
* A little over 18% of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will retire soon.
* All other departments have a lower percentage than the overall (outside of Managers but there are so few to begin with).
* There are only 1,549 employees that would be in the mentorship program. They might need to widen the criteria so that there are enough. 

## Summary
### Retiring Employees
There will need to be a total of 33,118 roles to be filled. The biggest holes will be in the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles.

### Mentors
There are not enough employees considered to be in the mentorship program. The Senior Engineer department in particular really needs more mentors. It is the depatment with the most employees and retiring employees yet it only has the 4th most employees to be in the mentorship program. This can be clearly seen in the image below when comapring to the other images in this analysis:
